Chart.js provides a number of options for changing the behaviour of created charts. These configuration options can be changed on a per chart basis by passing in an options object when creating the chart. Alternatively, the global configuration can be changed which will be used by all charts created after that point.

### Chart Data

To display data, the chart must be passed a data object that contains all of the information needed by the chart. The data object can contain the following parameters

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ----
datasets | Array[object] | Contains data for each dataset. See the documentation for each chart type to determine the valid options that can be attached to the dataset
labels | Array[string] | Optional parameter that is used with the [category axis](#scales-category-scale).
xLabels | Array[string] | Optional parameter that is used with the category axis and is used if the axis is horizontal
yLabels | Array[string] | Optional parameter that is used with the category axis and is used if the axis is vertical

### Creating a Chart with Options

To create a chart with configuration options, simply pass an object containing your configuration to the constructor. In the example below, a line chart is created and configured to not be responsive.

```javascript
var chartInstance = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
    options: {
        responsive: false
    }
});
```
