Chart.js provides a number of options for changing the behaviour of created charts. These configuration options can be changed on a per chart basis by passing in an options object when creating the chart. Alternatively, the global configuration can be changed which will be used by all charts created after that point.

### Chart Data

To display data, the chart must be passed a data object that contains all of the information needed by the chart. The data object can contain the following parameters

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ----
datasets | Array[object] | Contains data for each dataset. See the documentation for each chart type to determine the valid options that can be attached to the dataset
labels | Array[string] | Optional parameter that is used with the [category axis](#scales-category-scale).
xLabels | Array[string] | Optional parameter that is used with the category axis and is used if the axis is horizontal
yLabels | Array[string] | Optional parameter that is used with the category axis and is used if the axis is vertical

### Creating a Chart with Options

To create a chart with configuration options, simply pass an object containing your configuration to the constructor. In the example below, a line chart is created and configured to not be responsive.

```javascript
var chartInstance = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
    options: {
        responsive: false
    }
});
```

### Global Configuration

This concept was introduced in Chart.js 1.0 to keep configuration [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), and allow for changing options globally across chart types, avoiding the need to specify options for each instance, or the default for a particular chart type.

Chart.js merges the options object passed to the chart with the global configuration using chart type defaults and scales defaults appropriately. This way you can be as specific as you would like in your individual chart configuration, while still changing the defaults for all chart types where applicable. The global general options are defined in `Chart.defaults.global`. The defaults for each chart type are discussed in the documentation for that chart type.

The following example would set the hover mode to 'nearest' for all charts where this was not overridden by the chart type defaults or the options passed to the constructor on creation.

```javascript
Chart.defaults.global.hover.mode = 'nearest';

// Hover mode is set to nearest because it was not overridden here
var chartInstanceHoverModeNearest = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
});

// This chart would have the hover mode that was passed in
var chartInstanceDifferentHoverMode = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
    options: {
        hover: {
            // Overrides the global setting
            mode: 'index'
        }
    }
})
```

#### Global Font Settings

There are 4 special global settings that can change all of the fonts on the chart. These options are in `Chart.defaults.global`.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
defaultFontColor | Color | '#666' | Default font color for all text
defaultFontFamily | String | "'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif" | Default font family for all text
defaultFontSize | Number | 12 | Default font size (in px) for text. Does not apply to radialLinear scale point labels
defaultFontStyle | String | 'normal' | Default font style. Does not apply to tooltip title or footer. Does not apply to chart title

### Common Chart Configuration

The following options are applicable to all charts. The can be set on the [global configuration](#chart-configuration-global-configuration), or they can be passed to the chart constructor.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
events | Array[String] | `["mousemove", "mouseout", "click", "touchstart", "touchmove", "touchend"]` | Events that the chart should listen to for tooltips and hovering
onClick | Function | null | Called if the event is of type 'mouseup' or 'click'. Called in the context of the chart and passed the event and an array of active elements
